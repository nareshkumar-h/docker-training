#### What is Containerization ?

* **Containerization** is an approach to software development in which an application or service, its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as a container image. 
* The containerized application can be tested as a unit and **deployed as a container image instance** to the host operating system (OS).
